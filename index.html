    <h2>This is FriendBot</h2>
    <p>You can ask it about the weather, his maker, to dance, strike a pose, ask to play a game, & ask what's on it's wishlist by clicking on the microphone. You might need to give your browser permission in order for FriendBot to hear you. You may not always get the same response for some prompts. It will also respond accordingly to things it don't know. Give it a go by pressing the microphone now.</p>
