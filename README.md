# FriendBot
Some people talk to a duck while coding. You can speak to FriendBot instead if you're in the mood for some sarcasm. (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Speech Recognition Web API was used to be able to converse with the bot through the web browser.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

10/16/22 - FriendBot got some new features to show better expressions in the form of GIFs & learned new responses including dancing, playing a game, & wishlist. A description of how to interact with FriendBot was also added.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use the Speech Recognition API & that computers will only do what you tell it to do.
